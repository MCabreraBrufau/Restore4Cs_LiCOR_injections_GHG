#So: ppm = ((peaksum-Intercept)/(Slope*ml_injected))+peak_baseppm

#CHECK HERE if it works well.
#POTENTIALLY use 0 to substitute negative peak_base (the formula works considering the dilution of injection with the carrier gas, negative peak_base ppm is an error in the calibration of the instruments, so that the real dilution is cero.)

#5. RE-CALIBRATION-------


#AFTER MUCH THINKING and testing, we realize that the baseline must be included always in the calibration and in the re-calculation of concentrations. THis is because the peak-area is not proportional to the concentration of sample BUT to the difference in concentration between sample and baseline. 

#Theory for 1-point calibration: 

#Licors have a well-established cero (assumed), so that we can directly obtain a calibration factor based on a single value of base-corrected Area for an injection of known volume and concentration, knowing also the baseline concentration. 
#The area of the peak is related to the concentration of sample in the following way: 

#AREA = factor * (GHGinjection_ppm - GHGbaseline_ppm) * ml_injection

#Where: 

# AREA is the sum of the signal from the instrument over the integration window of the detected peak minus the baseline (i.e. base-corrected peak).

# GHG_injection is the GHG concentration (in ppm) of the injected gas

# GHG_baseline is the known GHG concentration (in ppm) of the carrier gas.  

#Vcal is the injected volume (in ml)

#The formula takes into account that the area caused by the injection is proportional to the difference in concentration between the sample and the baseline, that is, that the peak is affected by the degree of dilution of the two concentrations. 

#WE NEED TO USE THE BASELINE CONCENTRATION FOR CALCULATING THE CAL FACTOR (little effect) and for obtaining the concentration of all samples (little effect with UB injections usign synthetic air but very high effect for UVEG injections)


#We calculate the factor using the Average (central 95%) AREA for each gas from the standard injections of 1ml performed over various weeks from exetainers directly filled with the calibration mix.
