# Restore4Cs_LiCOR_injections_GHG
Repo for project-specific code to process discrete GHG samples from Restore4Cs project (cores, headspaces, N2O-chambers) analyzed via open-loop method with Li-COR7810 and Li-COR7820

Code in this repository is intended to be used alongside the general workflow in https://github.com/MCabreraBrufau/Measuring_discrete_GHG_samples_with_Licor
